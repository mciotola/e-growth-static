# Version 1.03.02  |  Written in Ruby 1.9.2

# The purpose of this simulation is to both show the 
# explosive nature of exponential growth, and to also 
# demonstrate the use of the Ruby programming language
# for such simulations.

To run this simulation, you will need to have Ruby
installed (at least version 1.9.2). For more information
about Ruby and downloading it, see the language site at:
http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/

Then download this program and use a terminal application
